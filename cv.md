## About me:
Today I have interest to develop in the field of IT technologies. The idea to try to learn frontend development came about two years ago. It has been an interesting and exciting journey, that I hope will continue. Unfortunately, so far I have not had the opportunity to try my hand at real projects. But every day I learn something new. I like to study, gain knowledge and skills that will help me get my new job.

## Skills:
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript (Basics)
* Git/GitHub
* VS Code

## Code Example:
* If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```
const getSum = (n) => {
  const number = [...Array(n).keys()];
  return number.reduce((acc, item) => {
    if (item % 3 === 0 || item % 5 === 0) {
      return acc + item;
    } else {
      return acc;
    }
  }, 0);
};
```
